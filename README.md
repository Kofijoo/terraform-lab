# Terraform Lab - Spiral Learning

## Overview
This repository contains my Terraform learning journey using the Spiral Learning Theory approach.

## Current Status: Loop 1 Complete ✅

### What I've Learned:
- ✅ Basic Terraform resources (S3 bucket)
- ✅ Remote state with S3 backend
- ✅ State locking with DynamoDB
- ✅ Proper teardown procedures
- ✅ Security considerations with `.gitignore`

### Infrastructure Destroyed:
All AWS resources have been properly destroyed to maintain zero cost.

## Next: Loop 2 - Production-Grade Security
- KMS encryption
- Bucket policies
- IAM restrictions
- MFA delete protection
- Multi-environment patterns

## Directory Structure
```
terraform-lab/
├── bootstrap/backend/     # Backend infrastructure (S3 + DynamoDB)
└── environments/dev/      # Development environment resources
```

## Learning Approach
Using adversarial mentorship with brutal honesty to achieve production readiness.

**Goal:** Battle-tested Terraform skills, not tutorial-following.
